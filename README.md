## Learing React & Material UI

### What I've learn in this project:
 - Create a file into Component folder called `index.js` to export all components and than you can import all of these in one line of code;
 - Create AppBar
 - Create Tab
    - Create a file to store my data, and using array.map to create tabs
 - Array manipulate using .reduce .map
 - Destructuring assignment
 - Creating Dialogs
 - Handle user inputs/click
 - Use withStyles connector
 - Create forms/dialogs
 - Change the state using setState
 - Delete from state
